The current administration has passed legislation that encourages electric vehicle (EV) purchases in the next decade. According to research outlets, there will be an estimated 15 million plug-in EVs on the road in 2030, 15 times the current number.\n\nMajor car manufacturers are planning to phase out their fossil fuel powered vehicles over the next decade as well, which is forcing corporations to determine whether their fleet vehicles are ready to transition to EVs.\n\nWhile you may be concerned about installation costs and whether your current or future customers will even use the EV Stations you install, it’s important to consider the projected growth in electric vehicle (EV) popularity.  A CleanTechnica report predicts a 70% year-over-year increase in EV sales in the U.S. With the introduction of plug-in hybrids like Toyota’s hybrid RAV4 and the plug-in Prius, more consumers than ever before are looking for EV charging stations and readily available EV infrastructure to keep their vehicles in working order. So, with these points in mind, there are three key advantages of installing an EV charging station at your place of business:\n\n**1\\. EV Charging Stations Showcase Your Commitment to Sustainability**\n\nAccording to an IBM retail report, more than half (57%) of consumers are willing to change their shopping habits to reduce their environmental impact. So, by installing an EV Charging Station, you may as well advertise that you care about the environment, and that may draw traffic into your business from consumers who care about the environment.\n\n**2\\. EV Charging Stations Can Earn Revenue for Your Business**\n\nWith EV charging stations in high demand in some areas of the country, there will be opportunities to bill users for the service. By taking advantage of local and state incentive programs and rebates, you may be able to mitigate EV charging stations’ costs and realize a profit more quickly.\n\n**3\\. EV Charging Stations Prepare Your Business for the Future**\n\nAs more Americans embrace a cleaner future, you can position your business with EV charging stations while realizing benefits that may enhance your profitability, while also providing a positive halo for your brand.\n\nChange can be difficult, but one thing that isn’t hard is the decision to call a trusted and proven partner like Connect Technology Group (CTG), to help you navigate all the things you need to know about EV Charging Stations, like:\n\n• What’s needed to install EVs in Texas\n\n• Overcoming real and perceived roadblocks to EV installation\n\n• Resources to help make good EV decisions\n\n### **Already Installed EV Charging Stations at Your Place of Business?**\n\nIf you’ve already installed EV Charging Stations, you’re probably wondering how long you can expect your EV Charging Station to last before it needs some maintenance or repairs. Well, depending on the quality of the device you purchased, an EV Charging Station can last between one to 15 years, on average according to statista.com. Let’s hope you made the right decisions, and your EV Charging Station will last for 15 years!\n\nContact CTG and let us equip you and your business with everything you need to know before you embark on your EV Charging Station installation journey.  And if you’ve already installed EV Charging Stations, let us provide an estimate for ongoing maintenance and repairs to be sure you keep those EV Charging Stations in good working order.\n\n**Call us today!
