# The City of Carrollton

![](https://ctgtx.com/app/uploads/2021/03/logo.png)

Connect Technology Group was contracted for a design to build installation for The City of Carrollton, specifically their City Hall building in Carrollton, TX. This $200,000 project consisted of structured cabling and fiber in the lower level of City Hall. Structured Cabling (Cat 6, Access Control, RG-6) consisted of 200 plus cables, which we tested and labeled. CTG also built out Carrollton’s telecommunications room with a custom rack design. For the fiber portion of the project, it was underground OM4 fiber and was engineered as a ring. The fiber was run from City Hall and connected back to the local Police Department facility. The customer was ecstatic at the end result and we currently have been contracted to do levels 1 and 2 of the City Hall remodel for 2021.
