# Crowne Plaza

Connect Technology Group was contracted to help a nation-wide known hotel with their space in Arlington, TX. We helped assist this client with interior and exterior Audio Visual. We installed 20 new exterior speakers outside of their hotel as well as interior in their lobby. Our client was satisfied with their new sound system.
