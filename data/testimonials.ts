    quote: "Very highly recommend Connect Technology Group (CTG). Kamrynn Roberts' team installed lines for 36 classroom phones. They were very courteous, professional, flexible, dependable, and did the work on schedule. They were sensitive to our school schedule yet got the work done promptly. CTG provided quality work at a very reasonable price. It is a pleasure to recommend CTG.",
