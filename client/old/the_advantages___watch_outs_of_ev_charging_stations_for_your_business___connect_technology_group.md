# The Advantages + Watch Outs of EV Charging Stations for Your Business

Nov 7, 2022

The times, they are changing – as the saying goes. The current administration has passed legislation that encourages electric vehicle (EV) purchases in the next decade. According to research outlets, there will be an estimated 15 million plug-in EVs on the road in 2030, 15 times the current number.

Major car manufacturers are planning to phase out their fossil fuel powered vehicles over the next decade as well, which is forcing corporations to determine whether their fleet vehicles are ready to transition to EVs.

While you may be concerned about installation costs and whether your current or future customers will even use the EV Stations you install, it’s important to consider the projected growth in electric vehicle (EV) popularity.  A CleanTechnica report predicts a 70% year-over-year increase in EV sales in the U.S. With the introduction of plug-in hybrids like Toyota’s hybrid RAV4 and the plug-in Prius, more consumers than ever before are looking for EV charging stations and readily available EV infrastructure to keep their vehicles in working order. So, with these points in mind, there are three key advantages of installing an EV charging station at your place of business:

**1\. EV Charging Stations Showcase Your Commitment to Sustainability**

According to an IBM retail report, more than half (57%) of consumers are willing to change their shopping habits to reduce their environmental impact. So, by installing an EV Charging Station, you may as well advertise that you care about the environment, and that may draw traffic into your business from consumers who care about the environment.

**2\. EV Charging Stations Can Earn Revenue for Your Business**

With EV charging stations in high demand in some areas of the country, there will be opportunities to bill users for the service. By taking advantage of local and state incentive programs and rebates, you may be able to mitigate EV charging stations’ costs and realize a profit more quickly.

**3\. EV Charging Stations Prepare Your Business for the Future**

As more Americans embrace a cleaner future, you can position your business with EV charging stations while realizing benefits that may enhance your profitability, while also providing a positive halo for your brand.
