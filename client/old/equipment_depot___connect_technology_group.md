# Equipment Depot

![](https://ctgtx.com/app/uploads/2021/10/ED-300x79.png)

Connect Technology Group was contracted for a “design to build” installation for Equipment Depot’s new North Texas Facility in Ft Worth. This $450,000 project consisted of structured cabling, security, automatic gates and audio/visual solutions.

The structured cabling consisted of 100 plus cables (Cat 6, Access Control, RG-6), certified to EIA/TIA standards. CTG also built out Equipment Depot’s telecommunications room with a modern rack design. For the security portion of the job, CTG installed 10+ Access Control card readers and interior and exterior security cameras. Then our team installed fencing and automatic gates for Equipment Depot to control traffic and secure their parking lot. Then, for audio/visual, we installed ten plus displays and engineered a multi-purpose training room used for conferencing. We installed overhead paging in the warehouse and office space, additionally, white noise speakers were installed throughout the office areas for privacy. The client is very pleased with their new building installation.
