# Is Your Office Prepared for Presentations?

Jan 16, 2023

With technology advances over the years, presentation expectations have changed. The reality is, in today’s world there are more distractions than ever before, and keeping people engaged can be a challenge.

Ultimately, engagement is the driving force behind people retaining the information that has just been presented to them.

So, aside from the information being presented, what can you do to ensure your audience stays engaged?

First, incorporating surround sound is of utmost importance when giving a presentation of any size, but especially a large group. If you have ever given a presentation without the help of surround sound, you know how difficult it is to project your voice as a presenter. For those who are listening, it is difficult to remain engaged if they cannot fully understand what you are saying. If a critical portion of the presentation is missed, the rest may not make sense, thus reducing what is retained.

Installing technology displays and video walls allow your presentation to be viewed by all participants. In addition, these are a great way to showcase videos to potential clients at gatherings hosted at your office, and are functionally useful for so much more! The commercialization of Smart TVs has brought another element of engagement into the mix. With an array of interactive elements, your clients and employees are sure to remain engaged for a longer period of time.

Adding special lighting into the mix is sure to wow everyone in the room. According to an article by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, lighting contributes a huge part to productivity in the workplace. The article indicates that lighting in conference rooms should have middle tones, producing an inviting environment while keeping workers alert. With that being said, including up-lighting, spotlighting, 3-D lighting, intelligent lighting, and so much more could be the key to keeping everyone engaged and alert throughout the presentation.
