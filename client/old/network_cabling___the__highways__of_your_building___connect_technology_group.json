With that said, these wires are an absolute necessity for any and all buildings. Is this the year for your business to expand? Whether you are building your first location, tenth location, or adding on to your current space, structured cabling will have to remain at the front of your mind throughout the process.\n\nWithin the sphere of structured cabling, there are several aspects and steps to the process. Because every business and building is different, no two solutions are exactly the same.\n\nEssentially Network Cabling is the backbone of any structure building, and because low-voltage cabling connects everything in the building together, it is referred to as an information highway.\n\nWhen one is cabling, they are laying the foundation for creating and connecting Local Area Networks (LANs) to Wide Area Networks (WANs). There are two basic types of cabling used in LAN environments:\n\n-Copper Cabling- Consisting of conductors that are insulated with copper, these cables transmit signals using electrical voltages and currents. This type of cabling is generally used for shorter cable runs, such as patch cables or equipment interconnects.\n\n-Fiber-Optic Cabling- Cabling that is made of glass strands transmitting signals as pulses or light waves. This type of cabling is generally used in high-rise buildings or campuses with multiple buildings. There are two ways to install this; single-mode is used for the longest cable runs, while multimode is used to carry the greatest amount of capacity.\n\nSpeaking of Fiber-Optic installation, it should be noted that whether it’s indoor or outdoor, there will have to be multiple telecom closets that communicate with one another. If outdoor installation were to be chosen, the cables are often buried or run in ducts, while indoor installs would be run through the ceiling.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the topic of installation, it’s time to backtrack to the very beginning of the cabling process. After initial consultations are complete, it’s imperative to look at the architect’s floor plan and create a schematic drawing overlay featuring network drop locations through computer-aided design. And there you have it! Now you know what you need to know before you call in experts.
