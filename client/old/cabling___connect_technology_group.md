## Inside Plant

Network Cabling is the backbone of any structure or building. In fact, you can think of low voltage cabling as the highways of the building, which connect everything together. We provide a range of cabling solutions utilizing a variety of cable types.

- **Category 5e through Category 8 cabling**
- **Fiber backbone and telecom room buildouts**
- **Wireless infrastructure/surveys**
- **Sound masking/intercom paging systems**
- **Assistance with relocations/reconfigurations/expansions**

Our team includes two RCDD Designers and Bisci-certified technicians to ensure expert installation. And, we provide a sample wire map with a labeling and numbering scheme of each network drop as a standard of CTG after-project submittals.

## Backbone

Indoor and/or outdoor fiber installs have to have multiple telecom closets that communicate with one another. We come to you and install connections for you to ensure above and beyond connection.

- **Multimode/Single-mode** **Fiber Optic Cabling**
- **Copper backbone**
- **Fusion mechanical splicing**
- **OTDR and Power Meter** **Documentation**

## CAD Design

CTG understands that a successful project starts with design. We can take an architect’s floorplan and create a schematic drawing overlay with network drop locations. With (2) RCDDs and AutoCAD experts on staff, CTG can meet requirements from CAD Design through implementation to As-Built documentation.

- **Site surveys**
- **Computer aided design**
- **Plant design**
- **System design**
- **CAD design services**
